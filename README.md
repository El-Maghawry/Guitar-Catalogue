# Guitar Catalogue

[![web](https://img.shields.io/static/v1?logo=heroku&message=Online&label=Heroku&color=430098)](https://guitar-catalogue.herokuapp.com/)

## Background
Project using the Angular framework, this is part of my effort to get to know the framework properly to be comfortable working with it professionally. The build has a login page, a guitar catalogue and the ability to save guitars from the catalogue to the profile page. On the profile page guitars can also be removed. Feel free to view the code and try it out (by pressing the Heroku button). I might return to this project in the future to add more functionality.

## Background
Simple project using the Angular framework, this is part of my effort to get to know the framework properly to be comfortable working with it professionally. The build has a login page, a guitar catalogue and the ability to save guitars from the catalogue to the profile page. On the profile page guitars can also be removed. Feel free to try out (https://guitar-catalogue.herokuapp.com/). I might return to this project in the future to add more functionality.
